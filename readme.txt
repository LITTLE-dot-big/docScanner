This is a simple program which detects any document which happens to come infront of the lens.
It is written in Python 3.7

Modules required:
    1. cv2 (OpenCV)
    2. numpy

This program uses trackbars to pass the critical values in the function which detects the document. Therefore the user can adjust the values thereby forcing the program to detect the document, if not detected on its own
